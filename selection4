    //when the user provides their weight and height. The BMI is often used to determine
    //whether a person is overweight or underweight for his or her height. 
    //A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:
    //BMI = (weight in lbs * 703)/ (height in inches)2
    //Where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. 
    //The program should display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight 
    //(BMI between 18.5 and 25 inclusive), 
    //is underweight (BMI less than 18.5), 
    //or is overweight (BMI greater than 25).
        
     //step 1: ask for user weight and height
     //step 2: calculate BMI
     //step 3: see if user is over weight, underweight, or overweight
